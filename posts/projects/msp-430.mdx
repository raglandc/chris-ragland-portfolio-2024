## Introduction

The projects described in this article are from a hardware elective offered at my university.

The class is an introduction to embedded systems. I enjoy learning about the low-level mechanics of how computers work. Even more, I enjoy building things that interact with the real world and the people that inhabit it. 

The semester begins with us writing the projects in assembly. The first few are very simple, single file projects, and the code for them can reasonably be displayed within the article. However, at some point, moving to C in the middle of the semester the projects grow and snippets of code are provided instead of full files. To view the full source code for the project, check out my github. 

Going forward in the article, each project begins with a description of the problem. Which is followed by the thoughts that went into implementing the project.Next, code snippets that describe how to implement the important features for that given project. Finally, a video that demonstrate the project in action. 

## Project 1: Assembly Language and Timer System

#### Problem Description

Produce an output in one of your LaunchPad LEDs when you press any of the push buttons on the LaunchPad.

#### Pseudocode

The simple solution to this problem was to implement a polling loop. Below I describe the actions necessary to meet the problem's requirements.

```
Setup:
  - Set P6DIR to output
  - Set P4/P2 DIR to be input
  - Enable pull up/down for both buttons
  - Set/select pull up for both buttons // active-low enable
  - Clear our LED1 (P1.0) // starts turned off
  - Remove high impedance

Main:
  - Check_is_pressed:
  - Test if button S1 is pressed
    - yes -> go to toggle
    - no  -> fall through
  - Test if button S2 is pressed
    - yes -> fall through
    - no  -> go to Check_is_pressed

Toggle:
 - toggle the bit in P6.6
 - Set R4 with very high value

Delay:
  - Decrement R4
  - Test if zero flag raised
    - yes -> fall through
    - no  -> jump to delay
  - Jump back to main // repeat loop forever
  - NOP // no operation
```
#### Code

```asm showLineNumbers
init:   
      bis.b #BIT6, &P6DIR 	  ; Set P6.6 as output
      mov.b #0, &P4DIR        ; Set P4.1 as input
      mov.b #0, &P2DIR        ; Set P2.3 as input

      bis.b #BIT3, &P2REN 	  ; Enable pull up/down for P2 button
      bis.b #BIT1, &P4REN 	  ; Enable pull up/down for P4 button
      bis.b #BIT3, &P2OUT 	  ; Select pull up for P2 button
      bis.b #BIT1, &P4OUT 	  ; Select pull up for P4 button

      bic.b #BIT6, &P6OUT 	  ; Clear P6OUT i.e., LED turned off on start

      bic.w #LOCKLPM5, &PM5CTL0   ; Disable GPIO high-impedance

main:
check_b1:
      bit.b #BIT3, &P2IN    ; Check button 1 (pull up) bit
      jz   	toggle_led      ; Jump to check again
      
      bit.b #BIT1, &P4IN    ; Check button 2 (pull up) bit
      jnz check_b1          ; Jump to check again

toggle_led: 
      xor.b #BIT6, &P6OUT   ; Toggle LED light on button press

      mov.w #0FFFFh, R4     ; Store big value into accumulator

delay:
      dec.w R4              ; Decrement by 1 on each loop
      jnz   delay           ; Jump to delay while R4 > 0

      jmp main              ; Repeat forever

      nop                   ; Make the assembler happy
```

## Project 2: I/O and Timers (interrupts)

Project 2 was definitely more involved then the previous assignment. This project was our introduction to using interrupts within embedded devices. 

Additionally, to reduce the number of ports used, instead of displaying the tens place and the ones place, we display one at a time.

We are constantly switching between which 7-segment screen we are displaying at any given time. However, it happens so fast that our human perception is not able to visibly notice the 7-segments repeatedly being turned on and off. 

#### Problem Description

Produce an output showing the use of Digital I/O’s and TIMER_B. We need to build a counter from 00 to 59 in two seven-segment displays. The counter should operate as a 60 second / 1 minute timer. When it reaches 59, the counter should rollover and repeat the process.

#### Pseudocode

Before beginning the program, we calculate the time with the following equation.

- △t = T ⋅ N 
- T = period
- N = count of overflows 

The frequency of the timer ACLK=32.768kHz, which makes the period T=3.052⋅10^(-5) s

- N=2^15 
- T⋅N = 3.052⋅10^(-5)⋅2^15 = 1s

Therefor we will use 2^15 as our initial value. 

Now we can plan out our program with some simple english-like pseudocode.

```
Init:		
      Set all the direction and output pins we will use
      Ensure they are initially turned off
      Disable high impedance
      Set up the timerB system
        > set initial value to 2^15
        > select ACLK and continuous
        > enable interrupt and clear flag
        > enable global interrupts
      Set desired binary for the segments into memory
      Set two pointers to point at memory and the values 
      we put into them
main:  
      Move the data for display one into our output ports
      Turn on display 0 and show the 10ths place
      Turn off display 0 and hide the 10ths place
      Move the data for display two into our output ports
      Turn on display 1 and show the ones place
      Turn off display 1 and hide the ones place
      Jump back to main and repeat
ISR_TIMERB_OVERFLOW:
      If Ones_pointer is at index 9:
        Ones_pointer = array.start
      Else:
        Ones_pointer++
      If Tenths_pointer is at index 6:
        Tenths_pointer = array.start
      Else:
        Tenths_pointer++
      Set initial value into TimerB register
      Clear the interrupt flag
      Return from interrupt
```

Now let's take a look at how we transferred out pseudocode into actual assembly instruction. 

```asm showLineNumbers

;-- Set up output pins
      bis.b #BIT0, &P2DIR 		        ; Set P2.0 as output (SEG - A)

      bis.b #BIT0, &P6DIR 		        ; Set P6.0 as output (SEG - C)
      bis.b #BIT1, &P6DIR 		        ; Set P6.1 as output (SEG - D)
      bis.b #BIT2, &P6DIR 		        ; Set P6.2 as output (SEG - E)
      bis.b #BIT3, &P6DIR 		        ; Set P6.3 as output (SEG - F)
      bis.b #BIT4, &P6DIR 		        ; Set P6.4 as output (SEG - G)
  
      bis.b #BIT0, &P3DIR 		        ; Set P3.0 as output (toggle LED0 10ths place)

## Project 3: Using The ADC (Analog Digital Converter)

#### Problem Description

Using the ADC System, produce a blinking output in one external LED on a bread board. The blinking frequency (hint: Time in between toggling) needs to be controlled using a potentiometer as an analog input.

#### Pseudocode

At this point in the course, I was feeling a lot more comfortable with thinking in assembly that my pseudocode could almost be directly transferred to assembly language. 

```
init:	clear R4				//will hold ADC result
		clear any values in P4OUT
		set P4 to be output
		
		change the function purpose
		in register P5 to be analog
		
		disable low power mode
		
		/* set up timer B */
		Clear timer b and its dividers
		Set initial value to 2^15 in TB0CCR0
		Set ACLK
		Put TB0 into up mode 	//overflow will be TB0CCR0
		Enable timer b interrupts
		Clear timer b interrupt flag

		/* set up ADC */
		Clear initial sample hold time
		Set sample hold time to 16 cycles
		Turn on ADC
		Set signal source from timer 
		Select SMCLK and single channel
		Clear initial 10-bit resolution
		Set resolution to 12 bits
		Set reference and input channel source
		Enable interrupt for ADC conversion completion
		
		Enable global interrupt
		 
		Enable conversion and start conversion

Main: 	loop to main forever waiting for interrupts

ISR_conversion:
		Move data in ADC into R4
		Multiply by 4 so the time is visible
		To our eyes
		Put that value into TB0CCR0 //setting overflow
		Enable conversion and begin conversion
		Return from interrupt

ISR_timerB:
		Toggle LED on bread board
		Clear interrupt flag
		Return from interrupt

```

#### Code

```asm
init: CLR.w R4                      ; R4 will hold ADC result, clear
                                    ; any previous value
      CLR.w &P4OUT                  ; clear any value in P4.0
      mov.b #0FFh, &P4DIR           ; set P4.0 to be output

      bis.b #BIT0, &P5SEL0          ; set P5SEL0 = 1
      bis.b #BIT0, &P5SEL1          ; set P5SEL1 = 1

      bic.b #LOCKLPM5, &PM5CTL0     ; disable low power mode

 ; --- timer b set up

      bic.w #TBCLR, &TB0CTL         ; clear Timer B and its dividers
      mov.w #8000h, &TB0CCR0        ; set initial value of timerB in
                                    ; CCR0 (2^15)

      bis.w #TBSSEL__ACLK, &TB0CTL 	; set clock source as ACLK
      bis.w #MC__UP, &TB0CTL 		; set counting mode to continuous
      bis.w #TBIE, &TB0CTL          ; enable TimerB interrupt
      bic.w #TBIFG, &TB0CTL         ; clear interrupt flag
      nop

; --- configure ADC

      bic.b #ADCSHT, &ADCCTL0       ; clear initial sample hold time
      mov.w #0210h, &ADCCTL0        ; set sample hold time to 16- 
                                    ; cycles and turn on ADC

      mov.w #0218h, &ADCCTL1        ; set signal source from timer 
                                    ; select SMCLK and single  
                                    ; channel

      bic.b #ADCRES, &ADCCTL2       ; clear initial 10-bit resolution
      mov.w #0020h, &ADCCTL2        ; set resolution to 12 bits
      mov.w #0008h, &ADCMCTL0       ; set reference and input channel
                                    ; source

      bis.w #ADCIE0, &ADCIE         ; enable interrupt enable
      nop

      bis.w #GIE, SR                ; enable the global interrupt
      nop

      mov.w #0213h, &ADCCTL0        ; enable conversion and begin
                                    ; conversion

main: jmp main                      ; loop to main waiting for interrupt
```

The main program is very simple, it sits in the main loop after the initial setup and waits for interrupts to happen. The entire application rests on the interrupts and what they do when called. 

Below are the interrupt functions for this program.

```asm
ISR_conversion:
      mov.w ADCMEM0, R4       ; move data in ADC memory to
                              ; R4
      rlc.w R4                ; multiply by two. Slow down 
                              ; frequency
      rlc.w R4                ; multiply by two. Slow down 
                              ; frequency
      mov.w R4, &TB0CCR0      ; put the output of ADC into
                              ; TB0CCR0
      mov.w #0213h, &ADCCTL0  ; enable conversion and begin
                              ; conversion
      reti                    ; restore stack pointer and status
                              ; register
ISR_timerB:
      xor.b #BIT0,  &P4OUT    ; toggle led on breadboard
      bic.w #TBIFG, &TB0CTL   ; clear interrupt flag
      reti                    ; restore stack pointer and status 
                              ; register
```

## Project 4: Using 4x4 Matrix Keypad, I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) LCD, & PWM

#### Problem Description
Using the 4x4 matrix keypad, LCD screen, brush motor, and the MSP430FR2355 micro-controller, the task at hand is to control the pulse-width-modulation (PWM) via user input. The user must be able to enter a number into the keypad, pressing enter and causing the number to display on the LCD screen. The MCU communicates to the LCD screen with the on-board I2C communication module. This number is then used to set the duty-cycle of the motor. 

#### Pseudocode

At this point in the class, we have finally switched over to learning embedded C. Assembly is great but C is just so fun and natural in the way we write programs.

Due to the project including several header files and source files I will only post the main file and the keypad file that describes the program for the most part. This goes for the Pseudocode and the actual code. 


#### Main

```
/* main */

Setup timerB0.
Setup keypad.
Initialize I2C communication.

Setup P2.0 to be the pin that sends the on signal to the motor.
Setup P2.1 to be the pin that sets the direction of the motor spin.

Take MCU out of low-power mode
Enable global interrupts

Setup LCD screen
Set initial message to be: “Duty Cycle: 0 %”

While(1)
{
	While (wait for user to finish input)
      {
	      /* spin until user presses enter */
      }

      For (small delay loop) {}

      If entered value < 100:
	      TB0CCR1 = new value from user
	      Ensure that the interrupt for ccr1 is enabled
	      Write the new duty cycle to the LCD screen
      Else:
	      Disable interrupt for CCR0 so motor does not turn off
	      No matter the value entered set LCD to 100%
      Reset variables (entered_value, is_complete, digit_count) to 0 for a new value to be entered by the user.
}
```

#### Keypad

```
/* keypad.c */

Void setup_keypad(void)
{
      Set pin directions for p1.0 – p1.3 are output, p1.4 – p1.7 are input.
      Enable resistors for pins.
      Enable pull up resistors for p1 pins.

      Enable interrupts for all column pins.
      Set edge sensitivity to HIGH to LOW.
      Lower flags for interrupts.
}

//interrupts
#pragma vector = PORT1_VECTOR
__interrupt void ISR_KEYPRESS(void)
{
      Scan the keyboard testing which button was pressed.
      Use this value to find its key in the 4x4matrix.

      If key == ‘A’ and user has not pressed enter yet:
            is_complete = 1
      Else if key is a digit:
            Add the entered value to the end of the already present value.
      FORMULA: value = (value * 10) + key

      Reset p1 pins for the columns and rows
      Lower all flags up for p1
}
```

These two files perform most of the work. Setting up the project and handling the user input into the keypad. The timer is responsible for turning the LED on and off. While the LCD code is responsible for displaying the current PWM Duty Cycle. Again, if you wish to see the full code check out my github.

The keypad is a pretty hefty file as it requires a lot of setup. The program itself for detecting which key is pressed is a tad bit more complicated as we use a technique that allows us to reduce from 16 wires (1 for each key) down to 8 wires (4 for the rows and 4 for the columns).

For a more detailed explanation of the code, watch the video for the project where I explain what is happening.

## Final Project: Bluetooth with UART, I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) LCD, & PWM 

#### Problem Description
Using the H10 Bluetooth module, LCD screen, brush motor, and the MSP430FR2355 micro-controller, the task at hand is to control the pulse-width-modulation (PWM) via user input. The user must be able to connect to the bluetooth module and via mobile application, input a numerical value, and send that value through microwave frequencies to the H10 Bluetooth device. When the user presses submit in the application, the values are transferred via UART to the MSP430FR2355 on-board UART receiver pin. The MCU communicates this value to the LCD screen with the on-board I2C communication module. This number should then be used to set the duty-cycle of the motor. 

#### Pseudocode

Similar to project 4, I will only display the main files that make the magic happen. For this project those are the main, timer, and bluetooth module files. I will only include the main pseudocode because the code portion is rather large and more important then the pseudocode taking up space.

#### main

```
/* main.c */
Setup timerB0.
Setup Bluetooth.
Initialize I2C communication.

Setup P2.0 to be the pin that sends the on signal to the motor.
Setup P2.1 to be the pin that sets the direction of the motor spin.

Take MCU out of low-power mode
Enable global interrupts

Setup LCD screen
Set initial message to be: “Duty Cycle: 0 %”

While(1)
{
	While (wait for user to finish input)
      {
	      /* spin until user presses enter */
      }

      For (small delay loop) {}

      If entered value < 100:
	      TB0CCR1 = new value from user
	      Ensure that the interrupt for ccr1 is enabled
	      Write the new duty cycle to the LCD screen
      Else:
	      Disable interrupt for CCR0 so motor does not turn off
      No matter the value entered set LCD to 100%
      Reset variables (entered_value, is_complete, digit_count) 
      to 0 for a new value to be entered by the user.
}
```
#### Code
